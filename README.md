# XBN Timestamp Project

## About this repository

[XBN](https://xbn.fm) wants to put chapter markers in their podcasts, and there
isn't any good software infrastructure yet to support that. This is the second
part of the two-part system that generates various metadata to be embedded into
podcast files or released alongside the podcast file. This repository is also
the working directory where most of the reference/development files can be
found.


## What you'll find here:

* **PostShow.py** - Audacity Marker Converter on the graph, generate CUE, LRC
  and simple timestamp files from an Audacity marker file
* **PostShowV2.py** - new and improved version of PostShow developed by
  [s0ph0s](https://github.com/s0ph0s-2). Changelog can be found
  [here](https://github.com/xbnstudios/show-scripts/pull/2)
* **Gelo** - Podcast chapter metadata gathering tool
* **mp3-chapter-scripts** - S0ph0s's scripts to embed chapters into MP3s. Use
  `chaptagger4.py` in production
* **auxiliary-scripts** - various scripts that aren't part of the main package
* **MarkerGen** - Script that was used to extract approximate metadata from
  [xananp's](https://twitter.com/xananp) tweets. Kept for posterity reasons
* **old-reference-livescript.js** - script that was previously used in
  production, now superseded by Gelo
